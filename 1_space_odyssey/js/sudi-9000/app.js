        TIMELINE of EVENTS
      ============================================================================================
       2001: A Space Odyssey spans from the dawn of man to its title year.
             Stone Age Earth:
             In the presence of a mysterious black obelisk, pre-humans discover the use
             of tools -- and weapons -- violently taking first steps toward intelligence.

        1999: On Earth's moon astronauts uncover another mysterious black obelisk.

        2001: Between Earth and Jupiter, the spacecraft's intelligent computer makes a mistake that
              kills most of the human crew -- then continues to kill to hide its error.

        2020: The sole survivor of the journey to Jupiter ascends to the next level of humanity.
 */

/*
  You are the sole survivor who will make the journey to Jupiter.

  But before you can leave you must build an autonomous humanoid robot to help you on your mission.

  This humanoid will be used to perform dangerous and mission critical tasks on your journey to Jupiter.
  - space walks to repair the spaceship
  - fight off alien creatures
  -

  The humanoid is your doppelg√§nger, a sentient being that will help you save man from extinction by keeping you alive.

  Using JavaScript build the software that will allow us to describe and programme the humanoid to do our bidding.

 7. Android Object REFACTOR:::::

 Level 1::::::::::::::
 Refactor (change) all the variables you have in place that initializes the android into an android object.
 - Your android needs a head, upperBody, lowerBody & [ anyThingElseYouCanDreamOf ].
 - Feel free to create any new properties that will further describe your android [ anyThingYouCanDreamOf ].
 - next update your application to use this newly refactored code

 tip: the console.log that prints the variables of the android will need to be updated

 Level 2::::::::::::::
 Refactor the planets array to be an array of objects, each object must be its own planet.
  - next update your application to use this newly refactored code
*/

/*
  8. REFACTOR Create functions:::::::
  Level 1:::::::::
  Refactor your application to be initialized by a function.

  Level 2:::::::::
  Look through your code and find more opportunities to use and call functions and parameters aka arguments.
  */

/*
    9. REFACTOR Arrow functions
    Level 1:::::::::
    Go through your application and convert all your functions into Arrow functions.
    If you only have one function, please make a few more it is possible to have one function per feature.

    Level 2:::::::::
    Create a few methods on your droid object that will allow you to update your object properties like isAlive, eyeColors etc.
